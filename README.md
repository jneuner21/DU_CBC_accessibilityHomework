# DU_CBC_accessibilityHomework

Homework assignment 1 for DU Coding Bootcamp

motivation behind wokring on this project was to optimive accessability for code that was already created, learning how to leave code better then when we found it originally.

This project was to clean up the symantics of a code that already existed. I went through and changed all my divs to asset names so that screen reading would be easier. Also added alt tags to all images.

I learned how 'divs' are slowly being phased out in the industry with 'containers' I was able to look at this as someone who reads code and not just writes it to better understand what coding should look like and how to have an understanding of what other people would look for when they are looking at code that I will make as well.
